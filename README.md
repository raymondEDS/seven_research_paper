## Abstract
This paper evaluates the fairness and influential factors in the peer review process of major machine learning conferences. It finds a weak negative correlation between reviewer confidence and ratings, suggesting higher confidence does not necessarily lead to higher ratings. Additionally, more confident reviewers tend to write longer reviews, but review length does not significantly affect ratings. The analysis shows a decline in ratings from 2017 to 2020, followed by a sharp increase in 2021, potentially reflecting changes in paper quality, review stringency, or external factors like the pandemic. The increasing number of submissions indicates growing interest in the conferences, necessitating adaptations in the review process. Despite efforts to ensure fairness, some bias persists, influenced by unexamined factors.
